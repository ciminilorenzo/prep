Just random exercises taken from [fastprep](https://www.fastprep.io/dashboard/problems), a website that collects real OAs from various companies. 

Some exercises don't have a public solution at the moment of writing this, thus feel free to give me a feedback either if you want to know more about a specific exercise or you don't think my solution is the best approach. Moreover, solutions are not tested over any possible test case but only with those available on the problem's description (look them up in test/).
